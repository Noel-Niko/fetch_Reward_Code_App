Hello,

This android application was designed to run with a min SDK of 26 and target of 30. 

An additional app-debug.apk has also been included for ease in downloading to run on Android Studio.

Requirements were as follows:

Display all the items grouped by "listId" Sort the results first by "listId" then by "name" when displaying. Filter out any items where "name" is blank or null. The final result should be displayed to the user in an easy-to-read list.

It was understood that instead of giving the user the ability to filter the data, it should be prefiltered as above and presented in the filtered form only.

Both vertical and horizontal layouts are included.

Thank you for your time and interest in reviewing this project.

Noel
